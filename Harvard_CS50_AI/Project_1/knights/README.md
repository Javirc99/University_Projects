logic.py file defines several classes for different types of logical connectives. These classes can be composed within each other, so an expression like And(Not(A), Or(B, C)) represents the logical sentence stating that symbol A is not true, and that symbol B or symbol C is true (where “or” here refers to inclusive, not exclusive, or).
Recall that logic.py also contains a function model_check. model_check takes a knowledge base and a query. The knowledge base is a single logical sentence: if multiple logical sentences are known, they can be joined together in an And expression. model_check recursively considers all possible models, and returns True if the knowledge base entails the query, and returns False otherwise.
Now, take a look at puzzle.py. At the top, we’ve defined six propositional symbols. AKnight, for example, represents the sentence that “A is a knight,” while AKnave represents the sentence that “A is a knave.” We’ve similarly defined propositional symbols for characters B and C as well.
What follows are four different knowledge bases, knowledge0, knowledge1, knowledge2, and knowledge3, which will contain the knowledge needed to deduce the solutions to the upcoming Puzzles 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Notice that, for now, each of these knowledge bases is empty. That’s where you come in!
The main function of this puzzle.py loops over all puzzles, and uses model checking to compute, given the knowledge for that puzzle, whether each character is a knight or a knave, printing out any conclusions that the model checking algorithm is able to make.
